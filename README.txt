#Simple Dungeon Game#

This is just a small and simple Python script, to understand the basic workflows of 'For Loops', which is wrapped into a newbie-friendly package.

The majority of this script is cosmetic, mainly to relate to the Python newcommer, and to introduce real-world deployment of some of the code they might be learning.

All feedback and insights are appreciated. :)

(I have attached a documented .py script, as well as the .exe for standalone testing, this .py script and .exe is just being run in the console...)
